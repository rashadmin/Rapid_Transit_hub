        <h1 class="text-center">Technical Overview of Rapid Care Hub</h1>
        <p>Rapid Care Hub is a groundbreaking project in the field of emergency response technology. This technical overview provides software engineers and developers with insights into its architecture, core functionalities, and technologies used.</p>
        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>User Interface (UI): The web-based UI is built using Streamlit for its simplicity and responsiveness.</li>
            <li>Chatbot Integration: An AI-powered chatbot, driven by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, processes user inputs and offers real-time guidance.</li>
            <li>Hospital Coordination: While a prototype, it simulates hospital coordination by randomly selecting hospitals from a JSON file and identifying the nearest one based on user location.</li>
            <li>Real-time Updates: Users can monitor hospital interactions, distances, and details through asynchronous operations and timer functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Technologies and Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Streamlit: The user interface is developed using Streamlit for its simplicity and rapid prototyping capabilities.</li>
            <li>OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo: The AI chatbot integration relies on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for natural language understanding and generation.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap and CSS: The UI is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS for an attractive and responsive design.</li>
            <li>JSON Data: Hospital data is stored in JSON format, facilitating retrieval and manipulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Development Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Multi-threading: The app employs multi-threading for concurrent execution of chatbot and hospital coordination processes, enhancing responsiveness.</li>
            <li>Exception Handling: Robust error handling ensures graceful resolution of issues during execution.</li>
            <li>Simulated Hospital Coordination: As a prototype, the app simulates hospital coordination by randomly selecting and identifying the nearest hospital based on distance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Rapid Care Hub is an exciting project that demonstrates the potential of technology in emergency response. While currently a prototype, it showcases AI, real-time updates, and user-friendly design, with future plans to establish real hospital connections for life-saving assistance during medical emergencies.</p>
